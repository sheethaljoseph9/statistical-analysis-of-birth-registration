# statistical-analysis-of-birth-registration

The goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on the percentage of children unregistered from 23 states in India over different years.
The identity of a person is determined from the moment he or she is born. Citizenship rights enable an individual to participate in society and use the 
resources provided by the state. They are more than merely gender, caste, or religion. Birth registration is usually seen as the first step toward establishing 
an individual's citizenship, or a state-recognized identity. "The child shall be registered promptly after birth...", according to Article 7 of the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). A birth certificate is an official document that verifies a child's name, birthplace, and relationship to his
or her parents and the state.

Not only is birth registration a fundamental human right, but it also contributes to the protection of children's other rights, such as the right to protection
from violence and critical social services such as health care and justice. The data gathered from birth registration records aids governments in deciding 
where and how to spend money, as well as what areas to prioritize for development programmes like education and immunization.Without a legal identity, 
individuals are never granted formal recognition by the State, and they are thus barred entry to countless social and economic opportunities.

For birth registration, all children under 5 years of age residing in fixed households were sampled—irrespective of whether their biological mother
is also resident in the household—and interviews were conducted with the caregiver. Children who had died, were living on the street or in state
institu- tions are not included in these surveys and we therefore expect to underestimate both the average percentage of children under five
without birth registration as well as inequalities in registration.Because of changes in both birth registration coverage and inequalities, only states with 
two or more surveys with data on birth registration were included in the analysis
